HOW CONTROL SIGNALLING WORKS:

CS0=zeros(CycleBatch,2);
DesiredSpeedTime=1;
TeamOwn{index}.Target = [tox toy, facingx facingy];
[CS,TeamOwn{agentIndex}.Target,TeamOwn{agentIndex}.TargetSpeedTime]=FUN.moveTo(agentIndex,TeamOwn,DesiredSpeedTime);

where in moveTo:
function [ControlSignal,Target,Time]=moveTo(index,TeamOwn,DesiredSpeedTime)
  AND
[ControlSignal, useless] = FUN.Get_Control_Signal(TeamOwn{index}.Pos, TeamOwn{index}.Target, TeamOwn{index}.Type, DesiredSpeedTime);
  WHILE
DesiredSpeedTime=1; for whatever reason

HLS returns ControlSignal, which makes stuff happen.
